# Instagram To Bluesky

Import posts exported from Instagram to a Bluesky account.

This utility reads an Instagram archive from your local disk and uses the official Bluesky TypeScript SDK to import posts into your configured Bluesky account.

[**An example of an account used to import posts from Instagram**](https://bsky.app/profile/mm-instagram-arch.bsky.social)

⚠️ We recommend creating a specific account to test the import and not using your main Bluesky account ⚠️

## Features

- Imports photos and videos from Instagram posts
- Preserves original post dates and captions
- Supports importing up to 4 images per post, splitting a post to incude all images and videos due to bluesky limits.
- Test modes for verifying video and image imports
- Simulation mode to estimate import time
- Configurable date ranges for selective imports

## Testing

The project includes a test suite that can be run in several ways:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (re-runs on file changes)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.12.0
    - .nvmrc exists, run `nvm use`.
- Your Instagram archive in JSON format ([download your archive here](https://www.instagram.com/download/request))
- A Bluesky account with an App Password
    - Verified email or videos will show up as not found.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.dist` to `.env` and configure:

```shell
# Your Bluesky username (e.g. "username.bsky.social")
BLUESKY_USERNAME=username.bsky.social
# App Password from Bluesky settings
BLUESKY_PASSWORD=your-password
# Path to your unzipped Instagram archive
ARCHIVE_FOLDER=c:/download/instagram-username-2025-XX-XX-hash

# Optional settings
SIMULATE=1              # Set to 1 to simulate import without posting
TEST_VIDEO_MODE=0       # Set to 1 to test video imports
TEST_IMAGE_MODE=0       # Set to 1 to test image imports
TEST_IMAGES_MODE=1      # 5 images in a post (all 4 should upload, plus a second post with 1)
TEST_MIXED_MEDIA_MODE=0 # many images and videos, single post split into 5, with a total of 10 media uploaded.
MIN_DATE=2020-01-01     # Only import posts after this date
MAX_DATE=2025-01-01     # Only import posts before this date
LOG_LEVEL=debug         # Set logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)
```

## Running the Import

You can run the script in two ways:

- Standard output: `npm start`
- With logging to file: `npm run start_log`

### Test Modes

The project includes four test modes to verify imports:

- `TEST_VIDEO_MODE`: Tests video import functionality
- `TEST_IMAGE_MODE`: Tests image import functionality
- `TEST_IMAGES_MODE`: Tests max image per post split functionality.
- `TEST_MIXED_MEDIA_MODE`: Tests posts with video and image formats splitting content to match Bluesky's limitations.

Enable these by setting the corresponding environment variable to 1. Note: You cannot enable both modes simultaneously.

### Simulation Mode

Set `SIMULATE=1` to run a dry-run that:
- Counts posts that would be imported
- Estimates import time
- Validates media files
- Does not create any posts

This is recommended before running an actual import.

## Limitations

- Maximum 4 images per post (Bluesky platform limit)
    - Splits posts adding a postfix `(Part 1/4)` ensuring no data loss.
- Maximum video size of 100MB
- Rate limiting enforced between posts
- Stories, and likes can not be imported.
