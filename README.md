# Instagram To Bluesky

Import all post exported from Instagram to a Bluesky account.

They use the official archive export file format from Instagram, this utility reads the archive from the local disk and using the official Bluesky Typescript SDK imports the posts into the configured Bluesky account.

[**An example of an account used to import posts from Instagram**](https://bsky.app/profile/mm-instagram-arch.bsky.social)

⚠️ We recommend creating a specific account to test the import and not using your main Bluesky account ⚠️


## Which posts are NOT imported

- Stories and post with videos, because videos are not currently supported by Bluesky.

## Prerequisite

- Nodejs >= 20.12x
- The archive of your post from the Instagram (JSON format), unzipped in your local disk ([click here to download your personal archive](https://www.instagram.com/download/request))

## Getting started

1. Install Typescript: `npm i -g typescript`
2. Install Node.js: `npm i -g ts-node`
3. In the project folder run: `npm i`
3. Create an .env file in the project folder by setting the following variables:

```shell
# username into which you want to import the posts (e.g. "test.bsky.social")
BLUESKY_USERNAME=test.bsky.social
# account password created via App Password
BLUESKY_PASSWORD=pwd123
# Where your archive is located
ARCHIVE_FOLDER=./transfer/place
```

**I highly recommend trying to simulate the import first and import a small range of posts, using the additional parameters documented below.**

## Running the script

You can run the script locally: `npm start` or `npm run start_log` to write an import.log file.

### Optional environment parameters

Additionally you can set these environment variables to customize behavior:

- `SIMULATE` = if set to "1" simulates the import by counting the posts and indicating the estimated import time.
- `MIN_DATE` = indicates the minimum date of posts to import, ISO format (e.g. '2011-01-01' or '2011-02-09T10:30:49.000Z').
- `MAX_DATE` = indicates the maximum date of posts to import, ISO format (e.g. '2012-01-01' or '2014-04-09T12:36:49.328Z').

### Notes
The Bluesky has an upload limit of 1mb for image files. The script will check images that are over 1mb and if they are will scale the longest edge of the image down to 1920px. Which in most cases will decrease the image filesize below 1mb. In cases where its still too big, the image will be skipped.
